Turbo360
========

Web search engine (Turbo360)  This project is mavenized and uses java, so install both of them.  http://maven.apache.org/  http://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp  Maven makes it quite easy to build and test the project.  Once you have cloned the project, from the project root you can execute:  mvn package  This command will compile, run the tests, package and emit an executable jar file into the /target directory.  You can then execute the jar file with the following command  java -jar target/instructor-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar 1  Alternatively, you can just use the command  mvn test  ..to compile and run the program without packaging it as a jar.  There are lots of convenient Maven commands: http://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html  Note that the project makes use of Junit. So problem modelling and solution verification should happen in those classes. Tests are located in src/test/java.  This project is configured to compile Scala and Java files. The jar file that is emitted will run on any JVM.  If you are using Eclipse install the Maven and Java plugins.  Let me know if you have questions.
